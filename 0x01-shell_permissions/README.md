# **Shell Permissions**
## **Introduction**
The shell is a program that provides a user interface for accessing the operating system's services.
Shell permissions, also known as file permissions, determine who can read, write, and execute a file or directory in a Unix-based operating system. There are three levels of permissions: owner, group, and other. Each level has three types of permissions: read (r), write (w), and execute (x).
> * The permission levels and types are represented by a series of symbols or numbers in the file's permission settings.

# **Learning Objectives**
At the end of this project, I was expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google and know:

## **Permissions**
* What do the commands ***chmod***, ***sudo***, ***su***, ***chown***, ***chgrp*** do
* Linux file permissions
* How to represent each of the three sets of permissions (owner, group, and other) as a single digit
* How to change permissions, owner and group of a file
* Why canâ€™t a normal user chown a file
* How to run a command with root privileges
* How to change user ID or become superuser
## **Other Man Pages**
* How to create a user
* How to create a group
* How to print real and effective user and group IDs
* How to print the groups a user is in
* How to print the effective userid

## **Requirements and Instructions**
* Allowed editors:
  * Vim
  * Vi
  * Emacs
* All my scripts were tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All my scripts were to be exactly two lines long:  ***($ wc -l file should print 2)***
* All my files were to end with a new line [(why?)](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/18743/whats-the-point-in-adding-a-new-line-to-the-end-of-a-file/18789)
* The first line of all my files were to be exactly ***#!/bin/bash***
* A ***README.md*** file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository was mandatory
* A ***README.md*** file, at the root of the folder of this project, describing what each script is doing was also mandatory
* I was not allowed to use ***backticks***, ***&&***, ***||*** or ***;***
* It was mandatory that my scripts be executable. To make a file executable, use the chmod command: ***chmod u+x file***.

## **Resources**
* [Permissions](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0090.php)

## **Important Commands Here**
* chmod
* sudo
* su
* chown
* chgrp
* id
* groups
* whoami
* adduser
* useradd
* addgroup



## **Note**

* I'm always exploring new ways to optimize code and improve system performance, and I'm happy to share my knowledge with others.
* I hope that my examples and projects will be useful to those looking to learn more about system engineering DevOps or those looking to improve their skills in this field.

* Please feel free to contribute to this repository or reach out to me with any questions or suggestions.

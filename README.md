# **System Engineering DevOps**
## **Introduction**
System engineering DevOps is an approach that combines system engineering principles with DevOps methodologies to improve software development processes.

It involves a holistic approach to software development that considers the entire system, including hardware, software, processes, and people. The approach focuses on designing and building software systems that are optimized for reliability, maintainability, and scalability, while also improving the speed and quality of software delivery.
> * By integrating system engineering principles with DevOps methodologies, organizations can create more efficient and effective software systems that meet the needs of all stakeholders.

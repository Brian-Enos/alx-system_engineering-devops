# **Shell, I/O Redirections and Filters**
## **Introduction**
Shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with an operating system through text-based commands.

I/O redirections are commands used to redirect input or output from a command or file to a different location. This includes redirecting standard input ***(stdin)**** and output ***(stdout)*** to files or other commands.

Filters are commands that take input from stdin, process it, and then output the result to stdout. They can be used in combination with I/O redirections to create powerful command pipelines.

# **Learning Objectives**
At the end of this project, I was expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google and know:

## ***Shell, I/O Redirection***
* What do the commands head, tail, find, wc, sort, uniq, grep, tr do
* How to redirect standard output to a file
* How to get standard input from a file instead of the keyboard
* How to send the output from one program to the input of another program
* How to combine commands and filters with redirections
## **Special Characters**
* What are special characters
* Understand what do the white spaces, single quotes, double quotes, backslash, comment, pipe, command separator, tilde and how and when to use them
## **Other Man Pages**
* How to display a line of text
* How to concatenate files and print on the standard output
* How to reverse a string
* How to remove sections from each line of files
* What is the ***/etc/passwd*** file and what is its format
* What is the ***/etc/shadow*** file and what is its format

## **Requirements and Instructions**
* Allowed editors:
  * Vim
  * Vi
  * Emacs
* All my scripts were tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All my scripts were to be exactly two lines long:  ***($ wc -l file should print 2)***
* All my files were to end with a new line [(why?)](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/18743/whats-the-point-in-adding-a-new-line-to-the-end-of-a-file/18789)
* The first line of all my files were to be exactly ***#!/bin/bash***
* A ***README.md*** file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository was mandatory
* A ***README.md*** file, at the root of the folder of this project, describing what each script is doing was also mandatory
* I was not allowed to use ***sed*** or ***awk***
* It was mandatory that my scripts be executable. To make a file executable, use the chmod command: ***chmod u+x file***.

## **Resources**

## **Important Commands Here**
* echo
* cat
* head
* tail
* find
* wc
* sort

* passwd (5)



## **Note**

* I'm always exploring new ways to optimize code and improve system performance, and I'm happy to share my knowledge with others.
* I hope that my examples and projects will be useful to those looking to learn more about system engineering DevOps or those looking to improve their skills in this field.

* Please feel free to contribute to this repository or reach out to me with any questions or suggestions.

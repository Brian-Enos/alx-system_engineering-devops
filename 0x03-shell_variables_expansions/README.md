# **Shell Variables and Expansions**

## **Introduction**
Shell variables are used to store values that can be referenced by commands or scripts in a shell session. They can be defined and assigned values using the ***"="*** operator.

Shell expansions are used to manipulate and expand the values of shell variables or other text strings. This includes expansions like parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and pathname expansion.
> * Shell variables and expansions provide a powerful mechanism for creating dynamic and flexible shell scripts.

# **Learning Objectives**
At the end of this project, I was expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google and know:

## **General**
* What happens when you type $ ls -l *.txt
## **Shell Initialization Files**
* What are the /etc/profile file and the /etc/profile.d directory
* What is the ***~/.bashrc*** file
## **Variables**
* What is the difference between a local and a global variable
* What is a reserved variable
* How to create, update and delete shell variables
* What are the roles of the following reserved variables: HOME, PATH, PS1
* What are special parameters
* What is the special parameter $??
## **Expansions**
* What is expansion and how to use them
* What is the difference between single and double quotes and how to use them properly
* How to do command substitution with $() and backticks
## **Shell Arithmetic**
* How to perform arithmetic operations with the shell
## **The *alias* Command**
* How to create an alias
* How to list aliases
* How to temporarily disable an alias
## **Other Help Pages**
* How to execute commands from a file in the current shell

## **Requirements and Instructions**
* Allowed editors:
  * Vim
  * Vi
  * Emacs
* All my scripts were tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All my scripts were to be exactly two lines long:  ***($ wc -l file should print 2)***
* All my files were to end with a new line [(why?)](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/18743/whats-the-point-in-adding-a-new-line-to-the-end-of-a-file/18789)
* The first line of all my files were to be exactly ***#!/bin/bash***
* A ***README.md*** file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository was mandatory
* A ***README.md*** file, at the root of the folder of this project, describing what each script is doing was also mandatory
* I was not allowed to use ***sed*** or ***awk***
* It was mandatory that my scripts be executable. To make a file executable, use the chmod command: ***chmod u+x file***.

## **Note**

* I'm always exploring new ways to optimize code and improve system performance, and I'm happy to share my knowledge with others.
* I hope that my examples and projects will be useful to those looking to learn more about system engineering DevOps or those looking to improve their skills in this field.

* Please feel free to contribute to this repository or reach out to me with any questions or suggestions.

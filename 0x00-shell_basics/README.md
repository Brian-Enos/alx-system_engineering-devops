# **Shell Basics**
## **Introduction**
The shell is a program that provides a user interface for accessing the operating system's services.
Shell Basics refers to the basic commands and concepts used in the command-line interface of a Unix-like operating system.  Shell Basics include navigating the file system using commands like cd and ls, creating, editing, and deleting files, as well as managing processes and executing programs. 
* .Understanding Shell Basics is essential for efficiently working in a command-line interface and performing tasks such as software development, system administration, and data analysis.

# **Learning Objectives**
At the end of this project, I was expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google and know:

## **General**
 * What does RTFM mean?
 * What is a Shebang
## **What is the Shell**
* What is the ***shell***
* What is the difference between a terminal and a shell
* What is the shell prompt
* How to use the history (the basics)
## **Navigation**
* What do the commands or built-ins ***cd***, ***pwd***, ***ls*** do
* How to navigate the filesystem
* What are the **.** and ***..*** directories
* What is the working directory, how to print it and how to change it
* What is the root directory
* What is the home directory, and how to go there
* What is the difference between the root directory and the home directory of the user root
* What are the characteristics of hidden files and how to list them
* What does the command ***cd*** - do
## **Looking Around**
* What do the commands ***ls***, ***less***, ***file** do
* How do you use options and arguments with commands
* Understand the **ls long*** format and how to display it
* A [Guided Tour](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0040.php)
* What does the ***ln*** command do
* What do you find in the most common/important directories
* What is a symbolic link
* What is a hard link
* What is the difference between a hard link and a symbolic link
## **Manipulating Files**
* What do the commands cp, mv, rm, mkdir do
* What are wildcards and how do they work
* How to use wildcards
## **Working with Commands**
* What do ***type***, ***which***, ***help***, ***man*** commands do
* What are the different kinds of commands
* What is an alias
* When do you use the command ***help*** instead of ***man***
## **Reading Man Pages**
* How to read a man page
* What are man page sections
* What are the section numbers for User commands, System calls and Library functions
## **Keyboard Shortcuts for Bash**
* Common shortcuts for Bash
## **LTS**
* What does LTS mean?

## **Requirements and Instructions**
* Allowed editors:
  * Vim
  * Vi
  * Emacs
* All my scripts were tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All my scripts were to be exactly two lines long:  ***($ wc -l file should print 2)***
* All my files were to end with a new line [(why?)](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/18743/whats-the-point-in-adding-a-new-line-to-the-end-of-a-file/18789)
* The first line of all my files were to be exactly ***#!/bin/bash***
* A ***README.md*** file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository was mandatory
* A ***README.md*** file, at the root of the folder of this project, describing what each script is doing was also mandatory
* I was not allowed to use ***backticks***, ***&&***, ***||*** or ***;***
* It was mandatory that my scripts be executable. To make a file executable, use the chmod command: ***chmod u+x file***.





## **Note**

* I'm always exploring new ways to optimize code and improve system performance, and I'm happy to share my knowledge with others.
* I hope that my examples and projects will be useful to those looking to learn more about System Engineering DevOps or those looking to improve their skills in this field.

* Please feel free to contribute to this repository or reach out to me with any questions or suggestions.
